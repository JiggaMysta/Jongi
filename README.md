 Ok, so pleae bear with me. If you see any mistakes then I definately did something wrong somewhere.
 Back again, it's the 2nd day of doing this shandis. Only two lines I did yesterday right? Well it's not so simple considering I am working and at home I have twins (4month y/o) 
 But today I am to do my resume.
